# About Me

## 👋 Hello!

I'm a guy from China who's dead set on living an interesting life. I'm not a programmer by trade, but man, do I love messing around with AI to tinker with code!

## 💻 My Coding Journey

There's something super satisfying about using AI tools to:
- Tweak programs
- Solve little coding puzzles
- Build tiny fun projects

No formal training needed—just curiosity and a lot of "let's see what happens if I try this."

## 🎯 When I'm Not Coding...

You'll probably find me:

### 🍉 Foodie at Heart
Chowing down on sweet, juicy watermelons (summer just hits different with one in hand)

### 🐓 Pet Chickens Enthusiast
Hanging out with my pet chickens – they're weirdly good at keeping me entertained

### 🛌 Sleep Aficionado
Snoozing in late (sleep is my love language, don't @ me)

### 📺 ACGN Fan
Geeking out over ACGN (anime, comics, games, novels—if it's got a good story, I'm in)

## 🧠 Life Philosophy

Life's too short to stick to one box, right? Whether it's playing with AI to bend code to my will or just chilling with my chickens, I'm all about chasing what feels fun. 😊
